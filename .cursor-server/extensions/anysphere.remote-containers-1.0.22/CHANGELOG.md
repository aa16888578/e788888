- Fix an issue where the `remoteEnv` was persisted across rebuilt containers
- Fix connecting to remote containers over SSH when using an explicit `user@host` in the SSH connection string

## 1.0.14
- Add support for dotfiles:
  - `dotfiles.repository`: URL of a Git repository containing dotfiles, or owner/name for GitHub repositories
  - `dotfiles.targetPath`: Target path to clone the dotfiles repository (defaults to ~/dotfiles)
  - `dotfiles.installCommand`: Command to run after cloning the dotfiles repository (defaults to finding first of: install.sh, install, bootstrap.sh, bootstrap, setup.sh, setup)
- Fix an issue where the workspace suffix was too long for the window title
